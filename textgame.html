            <p>In this project I worked on some of the if statements and helped my partner in deciding the players options. Some examples of my work are the options presented to the player in the first portion of the game and some of the if statements throughout. My favorite part of this project was adding Lavender Town music and the other sound effects. The most difficult part of this project was making sure to end the if statements correctly.</p>
