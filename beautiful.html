        <p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:18px; color:purple"; >(omg hi lol)Ashleyyyy, I know I say this a lot(hope it doesn't annoy you but if it does then sucks to suck lol) but you are 
        soooo pretty Ashley. You probably knew that lol but I'm sure you don't even realize just how pretty you are. It honestly worries me sometimes just thinking about how girls feel about 
        you when you have every guy's attention by just being within sight. The best part though is that, when I say you're beautiful I'm talking about a different kind of beauty you have;
        a beauty that surpasses any number of years. You're beyond pretty Ashley, like you're literally gonna be the cutest old lady too lmao I mean it. The fact that God would take such a beautiful
        creation (one that He carefully designed to turn the sand she walks on into fertile soil blooming with flowers, to bring warmth like the sun to one's soul with a smile, to cause all animals to rejoice together
        at her presence) and give that girl, the most amazing and beautiful girl, a heart for me, that's the most amazing miracle to have ever happened in my life. How wonderful it is to hear this girl, UUU, give her heart to me, I will protect and cherish it with my life.
        And how amazing it is that she holds and protects the chest and key to my heart, and will keep it with her forever (as long as I'm nice lol).</p>
