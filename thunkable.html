            <p>This application, for android devices, was programed usuing Thunkable. The application is a simple game that allows you to tap on vegetables as fast as you can within a certain time limit to reach the highest score.</p>
            <p>My main focus in the development of this application was the functionality of the vegetables and their interaction with the player and the calculations being made to update the score.</p>
            <p>The most difficult part of developing this project was solving bugs with the vegetables dissapearance and trajectory. I also designed the branding screen.</p>

            <p>Below are screenshots of the entire code of the program.</p>
