        <p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:28px; color:purple"; class="centertext" >(hi lol)ASHLEY YOU ARE THE MOST AMAZING GIRL EVER</p>
        <p style="font-weight:bold; font-size:18px; color:purple"; >Ashley, I know I've told you this before but, you are truly the most amazing girl I have ever met.
        From the moment I met you you've been the biggest blessing in my life and in ways I never could even have dreamt of because of how unimaginably great they are.
        I'm honestly pretty shook lol that it's even possible for someone to be as lucky and blessed as I am to have even met you, but so much more so by the fact that 
        you actually kinda like me sorta LMAO. Ashley idk if you even realize just how wonderful of a person you are. You have such a kind and forgiving heart(especially towards me XD)
        and from the moment we were friends I think I've always told you that you have a very motherly personality, and as I've gotten to know you I've come to realize that
        you're destined to be the most amazing mother there is. Ashley you mean so much to me, from the moment we were friends I knew you were special(and i always told u lol)
        I just never thought that I'd get to be the one to make you smile(like how lol idk what u see lmao). I wish I could see you everyday but as u say "life" (and i think
        by that point ud be like, omg sooo annoying -.- XD). I really feel like my life is a real fairytale because who would have thought that I would actually meet the 
        most amazing girl in the world, (and that she would be tweaked in the head by God to like me toooo).</p>
